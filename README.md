                                                                                                Smart Surveillance System

Problem Statement :

Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) is currently used in daily basis for a wide variety of purposes. The development of CCTV has transformed from a simple passive surveillance into an integrated intelligent control system.In this research, motion detection in CCTV video is used as the basis of decision making to produce automatic, effective and efficient integrated system. This CCTV video process provides main features such as motion detection, and many more.CCTV cameras are used for security monitoring and surveillance in any type of facility.These are staple in crime prevention because they help ward off criminals, monitor building premises, and record valuable footage of events.CCTV footage is displayed on a limited number of personal monitors and screens, not publicly broadcasted.

Proposed Solution :

Activity detection is a major problem in smart videos surveillance. It is a fundamental problem in computer vision. The traditional CCTV approach requires human interaction to work properly. It only stores the recorded footage which leads to extra effort while extracting particular information. It doesnâ€™t provides many features like motion detection, capturing etc.,  so to overcome these drawbacks we introduced a new system which implements features like motion detection, capturing, rectangle feature to focus on specified object in surveillance area, we detect any persons passed though the surveillance area and store their images too....hence converting traditional CCTV to smart CCTV. If a particular user wants to change their requirement they need to use other applications based on their requirement. We provided user friendly application that contains existing feature with extra features that we had implemented. Thus, it will reduce space complexity as well as time for the user.
